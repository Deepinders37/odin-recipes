Hello
My name is Deepinder and this project building a recipe website.
This project is to prove my HTML knowledge and see where have I reached
in the learning course.
These lines have been written before I start the project. I'll write some more lines when I finish the project, telling in which area I need "help".

This is me again writing after I've finished this project. I only needed to look up how the commands for height and width of the images. But for the rest, it all went pretty smoothly and was really easy.
Hope to do more projects, and every time more challenging.
